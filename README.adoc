A semi-portable package dedicated for running 
https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack[ComfyUI-3D-Pack]
on Windows.


## What Can It Do?

This build, `pt25-cu124`, is based on PyTorch 2.5.1 with CUDA 12.4,
targeting the
https://github.com/MrForExample/ComfyUI-3D-Pack/tree/a35a737676cf3cbb23360d98032870e242dae199[Dec 18, 2024]
version of ComfyUI-3D-Pack.

I tested all the example workflows on a fairly-old TITAN Xp GPU (12GB VRAM). The results are as follows:

|===

* Compared to the previous `pt24-cu121` build, the new `pt25-cu124` shows no regression in compatibility. All workflows that worked previously continue to function in the new build.

## Before You Start...

. Know your GPU's CUDA arch number. For example, RTX 2080 is `7.5`, RTX 3090 is `8.6` and RTX 4090 is `8.9`.
You can find the number in
https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/[this article].

. (Optional) If you want to use 
https://github.com/Stability-AI/stable-fast-3d[Stable Fast 3D],
you need a Hugging Face access token to download it.

** Register/Login
https://huggingface.co/login[Hugging Face].

** Go to
https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-fast-3d[Stable Fast 3D repository],
fill in and agree Stability AI's License Agreement.

** Go to
https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?tokenType=read[Access Tokens],
create a read-only token. Save it somewhere for later use.


## Download, Install, Compile and Run

### 1. Basic Requirements

1.1. Install 
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-1-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network[CUDA Toolkit 12.4.1].

** Only
https://github.com/YanWenKun/Comfy3D-WinPortable/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/cuda-toolkit-install-selection.webp[Libraries and Compilers]
are needed to install.

** If your GPU driver is outdated (<550), you can install the driver provided by the CUDA Toolkit installer. Otherwise, you don't need to downgrade the driver version.

1.2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022
(
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/[Page]
|
https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe[EXE]
).

** During the setup, select "Desktop development with C++" workload.

** (Just in case) If new major version of Visual Studio is released,
you need to manually select version 17.x (e.g. 17.12) and MSVC v143.
Referring to
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/12.4.1/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#id9[CUDA 12.4 compiler support].

### 2. Download and Config

2.1. Download the package files from the release page:

** https://github.com/YanWenKun/Comfy3D-WinPortable/releases/tag/r7-pt25
** Note that there are multiple files (compressed in volumes) that need to be downloaded. Extract it to a convenient place.

2.2. Edit `!FIRST_RUN-compile-install.bat`

You can see the line:

 set TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.6

Edit it according to your 
https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/[GPU arch].

For example, for an RTX 4060 Ti, it should be:

 set TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.9


2.3. Edit `run.bat`

You can see the line (again):

 set TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=8.6

Edit it like you just did in the last step.


### 3. (Optional) Extra Config

3.1. There are few more settings available in the start script `run.bat`, such as:

** Set proxy
** Do not open browser after starting

Each line of configuration has a description above it.
If needed, uncomment the according line (remove `rem` at the beginning),
edit it and save the file.

3.2. If you are going to run Stable Fast 3D workflows, you need to edit the start script `run.bat`, find the line:

 rem set HF_TOKEN=

and edit it to:

 set HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token

For example:

 set HF_TOKEN=hf_ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh


3.3. If you run multiple ComfyUI instances in Sandboxie, as a reminder, the `.bat` scripts should be executed in a sandbox.
In addition, I recommend to set the program folder (`Comfy3D_WinPortable`) to "Full Access" under "Sandbox Settings - Resource Access", to improve disk I/O.


### 4. First Start

4.1. Run `!FIRST_RUN-compile-install.bat`. Wait until it finish installation.

** Depending on hardware, it may take 5~30 minutes.
** If it fails, simply run the script again.

4.2. If you are going to run Unique3D workflows, run `download-models-for-Unique3D.bat`.

4.3. Run `run.bat`. After starting, the program will automatically open a browser, or you can visit: http://localhost:8188/

** In the left sidebar, you can find the "Workflows" button, the example workflows are listed there. The example input files are already in the `input` folder. Open a workflow and click "Queue" at bottom of the page to run the workflow.

** To shutdown the program, simply close the console window.

** To start the program in the future, simply run `run.bat`.


## Troubleshooting

### A. Force-Update

It is not recommended to update any component of this package, whether it's Python, ComfyUI or Custom Nodes
("If it works, don't fix it").

But if you really need to update ComfyUI and Custom Nodes (except 3D-Pack), 
there's a script to do that.
Run this in your Git Bash:

 bash force-update-all.sh

This script will force git-pull all the repositories.

Note that `ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-3D-Pack` folder is not a git repository, so it won't be affected by this script.

### B. Re-Compile and Re-Install Dependencies

Just like the FIRST_RUN script did,
the `reinstall-deps-for-3d.bat` script will attempt to compile and install the dependencies of 3D-Pack.

You need to edit this file and set `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` as well.

There are few differences from the FIRST_RUN, this script will:

** Download the latest source repos, not the targeted versions. This may help with compatibility issues when the FIRST_RUN doesn't work.

** Additionally compile-install `kiuikit`, `utils3d` and `nvdiffrast`. In my tests, it's not necessary to do so in the FIRST_RUN. I put them here for fail-safe.

** Keep temporary files and save artifacts (.whl files) in the working folder `tmp_build`, allowing you to reuse them. Keep in mind that they are not essentially portable.

### C. Last and Guaranteed - Linux

If you run into complicated compatibility issues, try Linux.

Everything in Comfy3D works more smoothly on Linux.
Most 3D workflows are research-oriented and far from production-ready.
By installing & running them you're essentially replicating the development environment used by researchers.
Many components need to be compiled before running, and this is exactly where Linux excels.

[[make-your-own]]
## Make Your Own

You can build this package using GitHub Actions.
Simply fork this repo and go to "Actions" page,
find "Build & Upload pt25-cu124 Package" and then find "Run workflow".

The GitHub workflow takes about 20 minutes to finish.
After that, you can find the 7z files in the "Releases" page.

Examples of custom modification:

* If you never use CharacterGen,
you can delete `diffusers==0.29.1` in `pakB.txt`.

* If you never use CRM,
you can delete `open-clip-torch==2.24.0` in `pakB.txt`.

* If you are using Ampere or later GPUs, 
you can enable Flash Attention in `pak8.txt`.
